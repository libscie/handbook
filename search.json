This qualification is rather unusual, and we did not take it into account in our initial reply to the similar case you brought to our attention.\nAs a result of the adjusted assessment, for German VAT purposes the transaction is qualified as a B2B rendering of services. In B2B cases the reverse charge mechanism applies. As a result,\n\nthe underlying invoices do not carry German VAT, but\nmust include a tax reference “Not subject to VAT acc. To Art 196 EU-VAT Directive”."

Travel is defined as a business trip to a different city than the one you are based in.\nFor all business travel, budgets need to be pre-approved by your direct manager. We will reimburse transportation and accommodation expenses after approval by your direct manager. For approval, please submit an estimated budget for your travel, specifying lodging, travel, and other expenses you might need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWe only provide reimbursements with receipts. Reimbursement claims need to be made within eight weeks upon return.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe adhere to the United Nations Daily Subsistence Allowance (UN-DSA) rates. Please check their interactive map here. This covers your accomodation, food, and all your other daily costs. If accomodation is booked through an agency, this amount is subtracted from your UN-DSA.\n\nNote that some places have multiple rates (e.g., New York City); a manager decides the applicable rate in that case.\nIf you feel that this rate, for special circumstances, needs to be adjusted, please consult your manager on this.\n\nFor example, travel to Berlin has a UN-DSA of $287, with 56% reserved for accomodation. On 2020-04-06, $287 is 266.03EUR (1:0.93); this provides 148.98EUR p/night for accomodation and 117.05EUR p/day for other costs.\nLocal transportation costs may be split out over multiple days equally if it is a multi-day cost.\nPlease note that the UN-DSA is a cap — we trust that you will spend it within reason. :)\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal & medical expenses: If you need to travel to countries that need a visa or other documentation to enter, we will in general cover relevant expenses (excluding expenses for issuing passports). The same applies to medical expenses, like medical insurance for travelers, vaccinations or examinations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel can be booked through an agency (we are still looking for one) or at your own risk. Booking agencies can help claim any compensation due to delays, deal with your rebookings, etc.\nNon-refundable bookings still count towards your budget. We recommend refundable bookings, or, if applicable, refund insurances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not cover flights, as per our Event policy.\n\n\n\nWe promote train usage, and within Germany we allow for first class train tickets.

    "section": "Terminology",
    "text": "Terminology\n\nRepositories\nOn your computer, you may have folders for different projects. On GitHub, instead of folders, you have “repositories.” Each repository contains that project’s files. For example, the repository for this handbook contains this entire website.\nEach repository contains a history of all the changes. This is helpful because it allows us to always go back to older versions if things go horribly wrong.\nYou can watch, fork, and star a repository. Watching a repository is subscribing to its updates (you will receive notifications of ongoing discussions). Forking a repository means creating your own copy of it. Starring a repository saves it as a favorite (an important metric for popularity too).\n\n\nIssues\nIssues are the primary place for open questions. Each repository has a so-called “issue tracker.” This is a great place to make suggestions and participate in discussions on how to change things.\nAnybody on GitHub can start an issue, so opening an issue does not mean it will be resolved. When opening an issue, it is important to communicate effectively and focus on making sure you provide all the relevant information to understand what needs to be resolved (communicate for the person reading it).\n\n\nPull Requests\nA repository goes through many changes - a pull request (PR) is a proposed change that is requested to be incorporated into the main version. It is good practice to only make changes using pull requests when a project hits the first complete version.\nWe maintain a “minimal pull request” standard. This makes it easier to manage many changes over time, as the energy needed to understand one pull request remains minimal. For example, if you’re substantially editing this page in the handbook, you might realize you also found a typo in another page. A minimal pull request would mean you separate the edits for this page and the typo on the other page into two pull requests. It may also mean you split the edits on this page into multiple pull requests if they are unrelated (e.g., correcting typo’s and adding a whole new section)."

Follow the link if you’d like more information: https://fourdayweek.com/\n\n\nOur regular hours are Monday-Thursday between 7am-8pm, in which you can flexibly allocate your hours. Our main operations timezone is Berlin (Germany; UTC+1 or UTC+2 during summertime).\n\n\n\nWhen you’re off work, you’re off work.\nYou are responsible for setting your own work hours, and when those work hours are over, you can truly unplug from work and are not expected to answer work-related communications. If somebody does pressure you to do so, reach out to the Code of Conduct committee.\nWe actively discourage you from installing any work-related communications (e.g., email) on non-company devices, to help with disconnecting and prevent feelings of having to respond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor more information, check out the Digital Justice project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess time at work means we all have to learn and help each other prioritize. This is a good thing.\nIt also has a lot of implications that may be uncomfortable. Some of you might struggle saying no to things, others might struggle with receiving a no. It means being honest and considerate with your teammates, but also yourself.\nCan you deliver what you promise? Does that meeting really need to involve everyone? Share your journey with your team, and when somebody shares their insecurities, thank them for it.\n\n\n\nYou can take 1-2 personal days at any time, as long as it does not interrupt operations. Longer periods have to be approved by your direct manager and planned at least a month in advance. You are required to take at least 25 days per year\n\n🌳 If you don’t schedule maintenance, it will schedule itself.\n\nNot all time off is PTO. Here are other reasons to take time off while working at Liberate Science:\n\nYou can get up to 6 weeks sick leave. Notify your manager on the first working day you are sick, and get a doctor’s note the same day.\nWe grant 1 day period leave every month for menstruating people.\nWe grant special leave for sick care, bereavement, and other scenarios to the degree we reasonably can given the state of the business."

Everybody who is on Liberate Science’s payroll gets to participate in discussions leading up to the changes.\nWage scales are separated for employees and formal directors. Formal directors are registered in the Chamber of Commerce, carry additional obligations and responsibilities, and have different contracts. Directors receive 12 months’ pay, whereas employees receive 12 months’ pay plus an additional 2 (holiday money, prorated according to tenure and paid out in May + December).\n\nHoliday pay is prorated on the basis of employment during the cycles May-May and December-December. For example, if you started on September 1st, you get 4/12th holiday pay in December and 9/12th in May.\n\nEach person in the organization is scaled according to their tenure in years with Liberate Science. During your first year after your start date, you are in scale 1. If you have been with the organization for 5 years, you are in scale 5.

    "text": "Vacation policy\nVacation days template\n\n\nPolicy\n\n💡 German employment law is rather complex and different regulations can apply for different conditions that might not be fully covered in this document. If you have any questions or concerns, please always feel free to ask your manager about your specific case.\n\n\nInternal policy\n\nThe maximum vacation days is 36 per year (= 288 hours) if you work the full year at 1FTE. If you started during the year the number of days is proportional and probably mentioned in your contract.\nEvery internal employee has a protected page shared only your managers, where the vacation days can be tracked. You have to manually input the number of vacation days taken. One vacation day equals 8 hours. One week off equals 32 hours (4 full work days with 8 hours each). The spreadsheet immediately shows how much you’ve taken already.\n1-2 days of leave can be taken without approval if there are no deadlines that are affected (please talk to your team members first about this), but need to be registered.\nLonger leave can be taken in consultation with your team members and manager. If unclear on who your manager is, consult your manager.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to our internal policies, there are also some legal requirements:\n\nAs an employer we have to make sure that you take at least four non-consecutive weeks off during the year. Also, one of the vacations you request need to be at least 12 consecutive working days.\nIf you get sick while on vacation, please make sure to get a medical certificate for the respective period on the first day of your illness and you get your approved vacation days back. In this case, you must communicate the address you’re staying at to your manager (SMS, WiFi, or postage costs will be covered by Liberate Science).\nPlease make sure to use your vacation days during each calendar year as your vacation days expire at the end of the respective year. If you are unable to use your vacation days for operational or personal reasons (e.g. health, maternity protection or parental leave), you can still use them within the first three months of the next year (i.e. until March 31)."
